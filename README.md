# Unhandled Exception in MyClass.compare()

This code demonstrates a common Scala error: failing to handle potential exceptions when comparing values. The compare method in MyClass does not consider the possibility of non-comparable values in the value field, which could lead to unexpected behavior or runtime exceptions.  The solution provided addresses this by incorporating robust error handling.
